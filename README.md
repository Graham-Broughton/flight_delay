#### Flight Delay Project
This is a repository containing Graham Broughton and Jasmin Smallwood's collaboration

You can find all our preprocessing in src/EDA_and_preprocessing any data visualization images are in the same dir in images

The final .csv's for training and testing were too large for git so they are not present but can be manufactured from the raw data in the data and PSQL folder

The final testing and predictions are in the root directory

Thanks for stopping by!
